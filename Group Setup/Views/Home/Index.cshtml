<ol>
    <li>Please input your n number below</li>
    <li>You will be taken to a hidden view page (from this index) with a few instructions.</li>
    <li>Follow the instructions and push your working results back.</li>
    <li>Please do not upload the work if you do not have a working build. I don't plan on checking every line of code.</li>
    <li>Please don't do anything but your part. It will be easier to see if everyone's work is in their spot.</li>
    <li>If you run into problems, or are not sure what you are doing, then please ask. That is why we are here. We all need to be able to do this.</li>
